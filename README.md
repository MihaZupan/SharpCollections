# Sharp Collections

A set of specialized high-performance collections, not available in the framework.

Compatible with Framework 3.5+, Standard 2.0+ and Core 2.1+.

Newer features (like spans) are available thanks to preprocessor directives.

Support for legacy platforms (<= Net 4.6) will be dropped, should they prove to complicate development.


## Currently available collections

#### Compact Prefix Tree

[`CompactPrefixTree<TValue>`](examples/CompactPrefixTree.md)

A highly memory-efficient string prefix tree.
